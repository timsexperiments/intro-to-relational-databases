- on 12 I put the book title instead of id. I didnt read (id only) till i had already finished it.

- on 18 I used DISTICT cause I knew the homework wanted it, but technicly one member can't review the same book twice in my system.

- on 19 I could'nt figure out how to display all books pertaining to the author in the same quiery because the having statement would filter that group concat too. I might come bakc tomorow and try to solve but im going to bed now
