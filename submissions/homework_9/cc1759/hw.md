## Homework 9 Notes:

- Read the next lesson to learn how to aggrigate before doing 13.)

- On 16 I reversed the order because for me phone numb is manditory and emails is not. Also I left the message for no contact info even though phone# is required just to show I know how.

- You didn't talk about INSTR in the lesson but wanted me to use it in the home work. I looked at the documentation to figure it out though.

- You should've mentioned the case sensitivityness of REPLACE but no big deal

- You left in the AI message at the top of hw9 (and 10 too) lol
