__NOTES FROM HOMEWORK 11__
- Its kinda weird that we have prices for books. We are a library not a bookstore... Therefore I put "market_price" instead of "price" to show it is not us selling them
- My computer broke and I had to factory reset it, but I got everything back set up :)
- (also I kinda forgot how to do some thigns in markdown... I'll have to reveiw on that lol)
