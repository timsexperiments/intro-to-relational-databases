# Homework 11: Combining Results (Set Operations)

## Objectives

- Practice combining results from different queries using `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.
- Implement simulations for `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` to solve practical problems.
- Explain your choice of simulation patterns and what they achieve.

## Instructions

For this assignment, you will provide two files:

1.  **`hw.sql`**: This file will contain the complete SQL queries that answer the questions below.
2.  **`hw.md`**: This file will contain your written explanations, particularly for the questions requiring `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` simulations.

For each question, include a comment in your `.sql` file with the question number. In your `.md` file, provide any required explanations for the corresponding question number.

### Questions

1.  **Combined Contact List:** Create a single, unique list of all people's names from the library, including both members and authors.
2.  **Full Name Roster (with Duplicates):** Create a complete list of all names from both the `members` and `authors` tables, allowing for duplicates.
3.  **Members Who Are Also Authors:** Find any names that are common to both the `members` and `authors` tables.
    - _(In `hw.sql`)_ Write a query that simulates an `INTERSECT` operation.
    - _(In `hw.md`)_ Explain the simulation method you chose (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `EXISTS`, `IN`) and why it correctly finds the intersection.
4.  **Inactive Members:** Find all members who have _never_ checked out a book.
    - _(In `hw.sql`)_ Write a query that simulates an `EXCEPT` operation.
    - _(In `hw.md`)_ Explain how your use of `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` correctly finds the members who are in the first set (`members`) but not the second (members with checkouts).
5.  **Un-reviewed Books:** Find all books that have been checked out at least once but have _never_ been reviewed.
    - _(In `hw.sql`)_ Write the query to find this set of books. This will require combining joins and a set difference simulation.
    - _(In `hw.md`)_ Briefly describe the logic of your query.
6.  **Library Activity Feed:** Create a single "activity feed" that lists all checkout dates and review dates in a single column called `activity_date`. Also include a column `activity_type` that says either 'Checkout' or 'Review'. Order the feed by the most recent activity first.

## Submission

- Save your SQL queries in a file named **`hw.sql`**.
- Save your written explanations in a file named **`hw.md`**.
- Place both files in:
  `submissions/homework_11/<your-github-username>/`
- Submit a pull request.

## Tips

- Use your test data from previous homeworks.
- Use comments (`--`) to label each query and explain your approach.
- Remember that for `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`, the columns in your `SELECT` statements must match in number and have compatible data types.
- Recall the MySQL simulation patterns:
  - `INTERSECT` can be simulated with `IN`, `EXISTS`, or an `INNER JOIN`.
  - `EXCEPT` can be simulated with a `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE ... IS NULL`.
- If you get stuck, review Lesson 11 or ask for help!
