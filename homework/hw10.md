Okay, understood! I've removed the explicit section headings (Part 1, Part 2, etc.) for the questions. They will now just flow as a single numbered list of tasks.

Here's the revised **Homework 10: Aggregation and Grouping** assignment:

# Homework 10: Aggregation and Grouping

## Objectives

- Practice using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`)
- Group data using the `GROUP BY` clause
- Filter grouped results using the `HAVING` clause
- Summarize and derive insights from your library data
- Use `GROUP_CONCAT()` for string aggregation (MySQL specific)

## Instructions

Write a SQL script (`hw10.sql`) that answers the following questions using your existing library schema and test data from previous homeworks.  
For each question, include a comment with the question number and a brief description.

### Questions

1.  **Total Members:** Find the total number of members in the library.
2.  **Total Books:** Find the total number of books in the library.
3.  **Average Review Rating:** Calculate the average rating across all reviews.
4.  **Earliest and Latest Checkout:** Find the earliest and latest `checkout_date` recorded in the `checkouts` table.
5.  **Total Unique Authors:** Find the total number of unique authors recorded in the `authors` table (or associated with books).
6.  **Books per Author:** For each author, count how many books they have written. Display the author's name and the number of books. Include all authors, even those who haven't written a book (or whose books aren't in your `book_authors` table).
7.  **Checkouts per Member:** For each member, count how many books they have checked out. Display the member's name and their total number of checkouts.
8.  **Average Rating per Book:** For each book, calculate its average review rating. Display the book's title and its average rating. Include books that have no reviews (average rating should be NULL).
9.  **Reviews per Book Title:** For each book title, list all review texts associated with it, concatenated into a single string. Separate individual review texts with " | ".
10. **Books Published per Year:** Count how many books were published in each year. Display the published year and the count of books.
11. **Number of Members per Email Domain:** Count how many members belong to each email domain (e.g., 'gmail.com', 'outlook.com').
12. **Most Reviewed Books (IDs only):** List the IDs of the top 3 books by the number of reviews they have received.
13. **Popular Authors:** List authors who have written more than 1 book. Display the author's name and their book count.
14. **Highly Rated Books:** List books that have an average rating of 4.0 or higher. Display the book title and its average rating.
15. **Busy Checkout Days:** Find dates on which more than one book was checked out. Display the `checkout_date` and the count of checkouts for that day.
16. **Members with Many Checkouts:** List members who have checked out 3 or more books. Display their name and the count of their checkouts.
17. **Top 5 Members by Total Books Checked Out:** List the names of the top 5 members who have checked out the most books, along with their total checkout count.
18. **Books Reviewed by at Least 2 Members:** List the titles of books that have been reviewed by at least 2 distinct members, and display the count of distinct members who reviewed it.
19. **Authors with High-Rated Books (and all their books):** List authors who have at least one book with an average review rating of 4.5 or higher. For each such author, display their name and a comma-separated list of all book titles they've written.

## Submission

- Save your SQL queries in a file named `hw10.sql`.
- Place the file in:  
  `submissions/homework_10/<your-github-username>/`
- Submit a pull request as described in the [submissions README](../submissions/README.md).

## Example Directory Structure

```

```

## Tips

- Use your test data from previous homeworks (ensure you have enough variety for aggregation).
- Use comments (`--`) to label each query.
- Remember to use `JOIN`s to link tables as needed for your aggregations.
- Pay close attention to the `GROUP BY` rule (columns in `SELECT` must be in `GROUP BY` or an aggregate function).
- Distinguish carefully between `WHERE` (for rows) and `HAVING` (for groups).
- `GROUP_CONCAT()` can take `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` clauses within it.
- If you get stuck, review Lesson 10 or ask for help!
